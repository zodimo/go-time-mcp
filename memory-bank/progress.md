- **Next Action**: To start a new task, use VAN MODE

## [2025-05-25] REFLECTION PHASE COMPLETE

### Reflection Document Created
- **File**: `memory-bank/reflection/reflection-go-time-mcp.md`
- **Content**: Comprehensive review of implementation, documenting successes, challenges, lessons learned, and future improvements.

### Key Reflection Points

#### What Went Well
- Unified Server with Mode Adapter design was highly effective
- Layered Architecture created maintainable and testable codebase
- Interface-Based Design improved modularity and testing
- Hybrid Error Handling approach provided structured errors

#### Challenges Overcome
- MCP-Go API understanding through package exploration
- Transport Mode Implementation through common interface
- Error Handling Complexity through structured error types
- Type Safety with MCP API through helper functions

#### Lessons Learned
- Interface-First Design improves separation of concerns
- Configuration Flexibility balances developer and operational needs
- Error Code Ranges help with error identification
- Transport Abstractions allow flexible deployment options

#### Next Steps
- Enhance with additional tools like formatTime
- Add performance benchmarking and metrics
- Create container image and client library
- Extend documentation and testing

### Reflection Verification
- ✅ Implementation thoroughly reviewed
- ✅ Success points documented
- ✅ Challenges and solutions documented
- ✅ Lessons learned captured
- ✅ Process improvements identified
- ✅ Technical improvements identified
- ✅ Next steps defined

## [2025-05-25] IMPLEMENTATION PHASE COMPLETE

### Key Achievements
- Implemented configuration management with CLI flags and environment variable fallback
- Created comprehensive time service with timezone validation and format support
- Built MCP server with dual transport modes (SSE and stdio)
- Developed typed error handling system with error codes
- Created comprehensive unit tests with 100% pass rate
- Verified server startup and tool registration

### Implementation Verification
- ✅ Directory structure created and verified
- ✅ All files created in correct locations
- ✅ All planned changes implemented
- ✅ Testing performed successfully
- ✅ Build verification complete
- ✅ Configuration testing complete

### Next Step
Ready for reflection phase to document lessons learned.
