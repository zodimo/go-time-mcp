# ARCHIVE: SSE Server Context Cancellation Bug Fix

**Date**: 2025-05-26  
**Task ID**: SSE-Context-Fix  
**Complexity Level**: Level 1 (Quick Bug Fix)  
**Files Modified**: 
- `internal/server/transport_sse.go`
- `main.go`

## TASK OVERVIEW

### Problem Statement
The SSE transport in the go-time-mcp MCP server did not properly use the provided context for cancellation, preventing graceful shutdown when the context was cancelled. The SSE server's Start method was blocking and didn't respect context cancellation, causing the server to hang or terminate improperly.

### Solution Summary
Implemented proper context handling in the SSE transport by running the server in a goroutine and adding proper context cancellation detection. Also enhanced the main.go file to distinguish between context cancellation (normal shutdown) and actual errors, improving the exit behavior of the application.

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Root Cause Analysis
- The SSE transport's Start method (`t.sseServer.Start(addr)`) was blocking and didn't respect the context passed to it
- When the context was cancelled, the server would continue running or terminate with an error status code
- This prevented graceful shutdown and proper cleanup of resources

### Code Changes

#### 1. Non-blocking Server Start (`internal/server/transport_sse.go`)
Moved the server start call into a goroutine to prevent blocking:
```go
// Previous implementation (blocking)
err := t.sseServer.Start(addr)
return err

// New implementation (non-blocking with context support)
errCh := make(chan error, 1)
go func() {
    errCh <- t.sseServer.Start(addr)
}()
```

#### 2. Context Cancellation Handling (`internal/server/transport_sse.go`)
Added a select statement to wait for either context cancellation or server errors:
```go
select {
case <-ctx.Done():
    t.sseServer.Shutdown()
    return ctx.Err()
case err := <-errCh:
    return err
}
```

#### 3. Graceful Shutdown Enhancement (`main.go`)
Updated main.go to distinguish between normal shutdown and errors:
```go
err := server.Start(ctx)
if err != nil && !errors.Is(err, context.Canceled) {
    log.Fatalf("Error starting server: %v", err)
} else if errors.Is(err, context.Canceled) {
    log.Println("Server shutdown requested")
}
log.Println("Server stopped gracefully")
```

### Testing
- Added a new test case `TestSSETransport_ContextCancellation` that verifies the SSE transport properly handles context cancellation
- Verified the fix with real-world testing using the `timeout` command:
  - `timeout 3s ./go-time-mcp -mode sse` - Confirms clean exit with status 0
  - `timeout 3s ./go-time-mcp -mode stdio` - Confirms clean exit with status 0

## REFLECTION SUMMARY

### What Went Well
- Clear problem scope with well-defined root cause
- Minimal code changes needed for the fix
- Improved user experience with better exit status
- Clean solution with proper goroutine management

### Challenges Overcome
- Goroutine management to prevent leaks
- Error propagation from goroutine to main thread
- Implementing consistent graceful shutdown

### Lessons Learned
- Context importance in long-running operations
- Effective patterns for goroutine communication
- Exit code significance in containerized environments
- Value of proper graceful shutdown procedures

## TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR FUTURE

- Create a unified shutdown mechanism for all components
- Add configurable timeout for graceful shutdown
- Enhance logging during shutdown process
- Implement health check mechanism for shutdown progress
- Add standard test cases for context cancellation
- Document expected exit codes and shutdown behavior
