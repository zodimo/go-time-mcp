## Current Context
- **Project**: go-time-mcp MCP server
- **Platform**: Linux (from user environment)
- **Language**: Go +1.24  
- **Framework**: mcp-go

## Key Requirements Identified
- MCP protocol compliance
- Dual operation modes (SSE + stdio)
- Timezone-aware time services
- Unix timestamp functionality
- Custom format support

## DETAILED REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

### Functional Requirements
1. **Time Services**:
   - Get current Unix timestamp
   - Get current time in specified timezone
   - Format time according to custom format strings
   - Support multiple timezone formats (IANA, abbreviations, offsets)

2. **MCP Protocol Compliance**:
   - Implement MCP tool interface for time operations
   - Handle MCP request/response format
   - Provide proper error responses in MCP format
   - Support MCP server metadata and capabilities

3. **Dual Operation Modes**:
   - SSE (Server-Sent Events) mode for HTTP-based integration
   - stdio mode for direct process communication
   - Mode selection via command line arguments or environment variables

4. **Input Validation & Error Handling**:
   - Validate timezone specifications
   - Validate time format strings
   - Handle invalid inputs gracefully
   - Provide meaningful error messages

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Low latency for time requests, minimal memory footprint
- **Reliability**: Thread-safe operations, robust error handling
- **Security**: Input validation, prevention of format string attacks
- **Maintainability**: Clean code structure, proper documentation
- **Compatibility**: Go 1.24+, cross-platform support

### Technical Constraints
- Must use mcp-go framework (v0.29.0)
- Go 1.24+ requirement
- Thread-safe time operations
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Minimal external dependencies

### MCP Tools to Implement
1. **getCurrentTime**: Get current time in timezone/format
2. **getUnixTimestamp**: Get current Unix timestamp
3. **formatTime**: Format given timestamp (optional enhancement)

## COMPONENT ANALYSIS

### New Components to Build
1. **Server Component** (`internal/server/`):
   - MCP server initialization and configuration
   - Mode selection logic (SSE vs stdio)
   - Server lifecycle management

2. **Time Service Component** (`internal/time/`):
   - Core time operations (current time, unix timestamp, formatting)
   - Timezone handling and validation
   - Format string parsing and validation

3. **Tool Handlers Component** (`internal/handlers/`):
   - getCurrentTime tool handler
   - getUnixTimestamp tool handler
   - formatTime tool handler (if implemented)
   - Error handling and MCP response formatting

4. **Configuration Component** (`internal/config/`):
   - Command line argument parsing
   - Environment variable handling
   - Server configuration management

### Existing Components to Modify
- **main.go**: Currently has placeholder code, needs complete implementation
- **go.mod**: Already updated with correct dependencies

### Component Interactions
```
main.go → config → server → handlers → time service
```
- Handlers use time service for actual time operations
- Server manages tool registration and request routing
- Config provides runtime configuration to server

### Component Interfaces
- **Config Interface**: Provides server configuration (mode, port, etc.)
- **TimeService Interface**: Provides time operations with error handling
- **Handler Interface**: MCP tool handler with request/response processing
- **Server Interface**: MCP server lifecycle management

## CREATIVE PHASE IDENTIFICATION

### Architecture Design - **REQUIRED**
**Decision Points:**
1. **MCP Server Structure**: How to organize dual mode support (SSE vs stdio)
2. **Component Architecture**: Layered vs modular approach for handlers and services
3. **Error Handling Strategy**: Centralized vs distributed error handling
4. **Configuration Management**: Environment vs CLI vs config file approach

### Algorithm Design - **MINIMAL**
**Decision Points:**
1. **Input Validation**: Timezone and format string validation strategies
2. **Error Response Formatting**: Consistent error message structure
3. **Performance Optimization**: Caching strategies for timezone data

### UI/UX Design - **NOT REQUIRED**
This is a server component with no user interface. Only API design considerations apply.

## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Development Phases

**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** (1-2 days)
- Set up project structure (`internal/` directories)
- Implement configuration management (`internal/config/`)
- Create basic server initialization framework
- Fix current linter errors in main.go

**Phase 2: Time Service Implementation** (1-2 days)
- Implement core time operations (`internal/time/`)
- Add timezone and format validation
- Create comprehensive error handling
- Unit tests for time service

**Phase 3: MCP Integration** (2-3 days)
- Implement tool handlers (`internal/handlers/`)
- Register tools with MCP server
- Add dual mode support (SSE/stdio)
- Integration tests for MCP protocol

**Phase 4: Testing & Validation** (1 day)
- End-to-end testing with both modes
- Performance testing
- Documentation and examples
- Final validation

### Implementation Dependencies
1. **mcp-go framework** (v0.29.0) - already added
2. **Go standard library** - time, context, flag packages
3. **Development tools** - go test, go build, linting tools

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Each component tested in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: MCP protocol compliance testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full server testing in both modes
- **Performance Tests**: Latency and memory usage validation

## RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: MCP Protocol Compatibility**
- **Risk**: mcp-go framework API changes or incompatibility
- **Mitigation**: Use specific version (v0.29.0), test against MCP spec
- **Contingency**: Implement direct MCP protocol handling if needed

**Risk 2: Timezone Data Inconsistency**
- **Risk**: Different timezone databases across platforms
- **Mitigation**: Use Go's standard time package, validate timezone names
- **Contingency**: Provide fallback to UTC with clear error messages

**Risk 3: Performance Under Load**
- **Risk**: High latency or memory usage under concurrent requests
- **Mitigation**: Use Go's efficient time operations, implement proper concurrency
- **Contingency**: Add request rate limiting and caching if needed

**Risk 4: Input Validation Bypass**
- **Risk**: Malicious input causing crashes or security issues
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive input validation, safe error handling
- **Contingency**: Implement strict input sanitization and logging

### Development Risks

**Risk 5: Complexity Escalation**
- **Risk**: Project becomes more complex than Level 3
- **Mitigation**: Stick to core requirements, avoid feature creep
- **Contingency**: Re-evaluate as Level 4 if architectural complexity increases

**Risk 6: Dependency Issues**
- **Risk**: mcp-go framework bugs or limitations
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, community support research
- **Contingency**: Consider alternative MCP implementations or direct protocol handling

## Current Mode: IMPLEMENT
**Objective**: Fix SSE server context cancellation bug

## Task Checklist

### ✅ COMPLETED - Previous Task
- [x] go-time-mcp MCP server implementation (Level 3) - ARCHIVED

### ✅ COMPLETED - Level 1 Quick Bug Fix
**Issue**: SSE server does not use context to stop when cancelled

#### Problem Analysis
- **Issue**: The SSE transport's Start method receives a context but doesn't use it for cancellation
- **Location**: `internal/server/transport_sse.go` 
- **Root Cause**: `t.sseServer.Start(addr)` is blocking and doesn't respect context cancellation
- **Impact**: SSE server cannot be gracefully stopped when context is cancelled

#### Solution Approach
- Run SSE server in a goroutine
- Use context to handle cancellation
- Implement proper error handling for server startup and shutdown
- Ensure graceful shutdown when context is cancelled

### ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED
- [x] Examine current SSE transport implementation
- [x] Implement context-aware SSE server startup
- [x] Add goroutine for non-blocking server start
- [x] Add context cancellation handling
- [x] Test the fix with context cancellation
- [x] Verify graceful shutdown behavior

### ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
**File Modified**: `internal/server/transport_sse.go`

**Changes Made**:
1. **Non-blocking Server Start**: Moved `t.sseServer.Start(addr)` into a goroutine to prevent blocking
2. **Context Cancellation Handling**: Added `select` statement to wait for either context cancellation or server errors
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: When context is cancelled, the server is properly shut down using `t.sseServer.Shutdown()`
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error propagation for both context cancellation and server startup failures

**Test Coverage**: Added `TestSSETransport_ContextCancellation` to verify the fix works correctly

### ✅ VERIFICATION RESULTS

**Solution**: Updated main.go to distinguish between context cancellation (normal shutdown) and actual errors

**Changes Made**:
- Added context cancellation detection in main.go
- Context cancellation now logs "Server shutdown requested" instead of treating it as a fatal error
- Application now exits with status 0 for graceful shutdowns
- Updated final message to "Server stopped gracefully"

### ✅ ENHANCED VERIFICATION RESULTS
- [x] **SSE Mode Graceful Shutdown**: `timeout 3s ./go-time-mcp -mode sse` - exits cleanly with status 0
- [x] **Stdio Mode Graceful Shutdown**: `timeout 3s ./go-time-mcp -mode stdio` - exits cleanly with status 0
- [x] **Context Cancellation Handling**: Both transport modes properly handle context cancellation
- [x] **Clean Exit**: Application no longer exits with error status during normal shutdown
