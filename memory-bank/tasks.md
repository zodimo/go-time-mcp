### ðŸš« CRITICAL GATE: FORCE MODE SWITCH

### ðŸš« MANDATORY MODE TRANSITION
**LEVEL 3 TASK DETECTED - VAN MODE BLOCKED**

This task requires PLAN mode for proper documentation and planning.
**You MUST switch to PLAN mode.**

**Type 'PLAN' to switch to planning mode**

## Current Context
- **Project**: go-time-mcp MCP server
- **Platform**: Linux (from user environment)
- **Language**: Go +1.24  
- **Framework**: mcp-go

## Key Requirements Identified
- MCP protocol compliance
- Dual operation modes (SSE + stdio)
- Timezone-aware time services
- Unix timestamp functionality
- Custom format support

## Next Immediate Action
Begin platform detection process for Linux environment.
