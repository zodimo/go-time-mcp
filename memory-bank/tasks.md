## DETAILED REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

### Functional Requirements
1. **Automated Testing**:
   - Run tests on push to main branch
   - Run tests on pull requests
   - Execute `go test ./...` for all packages
   - Run `go build` to ensure compilation
   - Run `go vet` for code quality checks

2. **Multi-Version Testing**:
   - Test against Go 1.24 (minimum required version)
   - Future: Add Go 1.25 when released (August 2025)
   - Focused testing on supported versions only

3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - GitHub Actions workflow integration
   - Proper status reporting
   - Failed test reporting
   - Build artifact handling

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Fast workflow execution (< 5 minutes)
- **Reliability**: Consistent test results across runs
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update and modify
- **Visibility**: Clear status indicators and logs

### Technical Constraints
- Must use GitHub Actions platform
- Go 1.24+ requirement (from go.mod)
- Linux runner environment
- Standard Go toolchain

### Current Test Structure Analysis
- **Existing Tests**: 
  - `internal/server/transport_sse_test.go` (SSE transport tests)
  - `internal/services/time_test.go` (time service tests)
- **Test Coverage**: 
  - Services layer: ✅ Complete
  - Server layer: ✅ Basic coverage
  - Config layer: ❌ No tests (acceptable for Level 2)
- **Test Commands**: `go test ./...` works successfully
- **Go Version**: Minimum 1.24 (specified in go.mod) - leverages latest performance improvements

## COMPONENT ANALYSIS

### New Components to Build
1. **GitHub Workflow File** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`):
   - Workflow configuration in YAML format
   - Job definitions for testing
   - Matrix strategy for Go versions
   - Steps for checkout, setup, build, and test

### Existing Components (No Modification Required)
- **Test Files**: Current tests will be executed by workflow
- **Go Module**: `go.mod` already specifies Go 1.24 requirement
- **Project Structure**: Already supports `go test ./...`

### Workflow Structure
```
.github/workflows/test.yml
├── Trigger Events (push, pull_request)
├── Job: test
│   ├── Strategy Matrix (Go versions)
│   ├── Steps:
│   │   ├── Checkout code
│   │   ├── Setup Go
│   │   ├── Cache dependencies
│   │   ├── Run go mod download
│   │   ├── Run go vet
│   │   ├── Run go build
│   │   └── Run go test
```

## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Single-Phase Implementation
**Phase 1: Workflow Creation** (Estimated: 15-30 minutes)
- Create `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- Configure trigger events
- Set up Go version matrix
- Add build and test steps
- Test workflow execution

### Implementation Roadmap
1. **Create Workflow File**: Basic structure with standard Go actions
2. **Configure Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests
3. **Setup Go Matrix**: Test Go 1.24 and 1.25
4. **Add Test Steps**: vet, build, test commands
5. **Validate Workflow**: Push and verify execution

### Dependencies
- **GitHub Actions**: uses: actions/checkout@v4, actions/setup-go@v5
- **Go Toolchain**: Available in GitHub runners
- **Project Dependencies**: Already in go.mod

### Testing Approach
- **Workflow Testing**: Push commit to trigger workflow
- **Verification**: Check GitHub Actions tab for results
- **Validation**: Ensure all jobs pass successfully

## RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Workflow Configuration Errors**
- **Risk**: YAML syntax errors or incorrect action versions
- **Mitigation**: Use standard GitHub Actions templates and validate syntax
- **Contingency**: Test with minimal workflow first, then expand

**Risk 2: Go Version Compatibility**
- **Risk**: Tests fail on different Go versions
- **Mitigation**: Test matrix includes current project version (1.24)
- **Contingency**: Remove problematic versions from matrix if needed

**Risk 3: Test Dependencies**
- **Risk**: Tests require external dependencies or services
- **Mitigation**: Current tests are self-contained, no external deps
- **Contingency**: Add service containers if needed (not required for current tests)

### Implementation Risks

**Risk 4: Workflow Permissions**
- **Risk**: Insufficient permissions for workflow execution
- **Mitigation**: Use standard read permissions (sufficient for testing)
- **Contingency**: Adjust permissions if needed
