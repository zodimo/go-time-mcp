# ACTIVE CONTEXT

## Current Focus
**CREATIVE Mode Complete - Implementation Ready**: All architecture design decisions completed for Level 3 go-time-mcp MCP server. Ready for implementation phase with clear architectural guidance.

## Current Phase
**CREATIVE Mode Complete - Awaiting IMPLEMENT Mode**

## Active Task
CREATIVE mode completed successfully. All 4 architecture design decisions made and documented. Ready for IMPLEMENT mode to begin structured development based on architectural decisions.

## Key Context Items

### Project Identity
- **Name**: go-time-mcp
- **Type**: Go MCP Server Package
- **Primary Function**: Time service provider with timezone and format flexibility

### Technical Stack
- **Language**: Go +1.24
- **Framework**: mcp-go from mark3labs
- **Modes**: SSE server and stdio operation modes

### Current Understanding
- This is a time-focused MCP server project
- Requires dual operation mode support (SSE and stdio)
- Needs timezone-aware time formatting capabilities
- Must provide unix timestamp functionality
- Should follow MCP protocol standards

### VAN Mode Completion Status
1. ✅ Memory Bank structure created
2. ✅ Platform detection completed (Linux)
3. ✅ File verification completed
4. ✅ Complexity determination completed (Level 3)
5. ✅ Mode transition triggered

## Recent Updates
- VAN mode initialization completed successfully
- All checkpoints passed (Memory Bank, Platform, File Verification, Complexity)
- Project determined to be Level 3: Intermediate Feature
- Mode transition to PLAN required for proper planning and design

## Current Status
**Status**: VAN Mode COMPLETE - Level 3 complexity determined
**Next Action**: User must type 'PLAN' to begin planning phase
