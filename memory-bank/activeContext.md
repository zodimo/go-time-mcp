- **Next Available Mode**: VAN (Initialize new task analysis)

## Recently Completed
- **GitHub Workflow Enhancement** (Level 2) completed on 2025-05-27
- **Archive**: [docs/archive/enhancements/2025-05/github-actions-workflow.md](../docs/archive/enhancements/2025-05/github-actions-workflow.md)
- **Outcome**: Production-ready CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive testing
- **Memory Bank**: All documentation preserved and cross-referenced

## Notes
- **LAST TASK**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- **COMPLETION STATUS**: ✅ FULLY ARCHIVED - All documentation preserved
- **PROCESS VALIDATION**: Full VAN → PLAN → BUILD → REFLECT → ARCHIVE workflow completed successfully
- **KNOWLEDGE PRESERVED**: Technical decisions, bug fixes, lessons learned all documented
- **READY STATE**: Memory Bank cleared and ready for new task initiation

## Current Focus
**NEW TASK READY**: Project now has:
- Production-ready CI/CD pipeline with Go 1.24 support
- Comprehensive testing (vet, build, race detection, coverage)
- Automated testing on push/PR events
- Complete documentation and knowledge preservation

**Available for**: New development tasks or enhancements via VAN mode

## Development Capability Status
- **CI/CD**: ✅ Fully operational automated testing pipeline
- **Core Services**: ✅ Time service functionality complete
- **Testing**: ✅ Comprehensive test coverage with race detection
- **Documentation**: ✅ Complete user and developer documentation
- **Process**: ✅ Validated Memory Bank development methodology

**Next Task Options**: Additional MCP tools, performance optimizations, or new features

## Key Context Items

### Project Identity
- **Name**: go-time-mcp
- **Type**: Go MCP Server Package
- **Primary Function**: Time service provider with timezone and format flexibility

### Technical Stack
- **Language**: Go +1.24
- **Framework**: mcp-go from mark3labs
- **Modes**: SSE server and stdio operation modes

### Current Understanding
- This is a time-focused MCP server project
- Requires dual operation mode support (SSE and stdio)
- Needs timezone-aware time formatting capabilities
- Must provide unix timestamp functionality
- Should follow MCP protocol standards

### VAN Mode Completion Status
1. ✅ Memory Bank structure created
2. ✅ Platform detection completed (Linux)
3. ✅ File verification completed
4. ✅ Complexity determination completed (Level 3)
5. ✅ Mode transition triggered

## Recent Updates
- VAN mode initialization completed successfully
- All checkpoints passed (Memory Bank, Platform, File Verification, Complexity)
- Project determined to be Level 3: Intermediate Feature
- Mode transition to PLAN required for proper planning and design

## Current Status
**Status**: VAN Mode COMPLETE - Level 3 complexity determined
**Next Action**: User must type 'PLAN' to begin planning phase
