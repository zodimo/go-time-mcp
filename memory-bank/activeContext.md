# ACTIVE CONTEXT

## Project Information
- **Project**: go-time-mcp MCP server
- **Repository**: /home/jaco/SecondBrain/1-Projects/GoProjects/Development/go-time-mcp
- **Language**: Go 1.24+
- **Framework**: mcp-go v0.29.0

## Current State
- **Last Completed Task**: SSE server context cancellation bug fix (Level 1) - ARCHIVED
- **Status**: Ready for next task
- **Archive Reference**: [memory-bank/archive/archive-sse-context-fix.md](memory-bank/archive/archive-sse-context-fix.md)

## Project Structure
- `cmd/` - Command line entry points
- `internal/` - Internal packages
  - `config/` - Configuration management
  - `server/` - MCP server implementation
  - `services/` - Core time service implementations
- `main.go` - Main application entry point
- `go.mod` - Go module definition

## Recent Improvements
- Added proper context cancellation handling to SSE transport
- Enhanced main.go to distinguish between normal shutdown and errors
- Improved exit behavior with proper exit codes
- Added testing for context cancellation scenarios

## Next Steps
- Consider reviewing other transports for similar issues
- Add more comprehensive tests for shutdown scenarios
- Document shutdown behavior
- Consider implementing a cleanup hook system

## Mode Status
- **Current Mode**: NONE (Ready for VAN mode to begin next task)
- **Last Mode**: ARCHIVE (Completed archive of SSE context cancellation bug fix)

## Notes
- Remember to follow the established architecture pattern when making changes
- Maintain the clean separation between transport and business logic
- Continue the pattern of comprehensive testing for all changes
- Ensure all components properly handle context cancellation

## Current Focus
**TASK COMPLETED**: Level 1 Quick Bug Fix - SSE server context cancellation issue has been successfully resolved.

## Current Phase
**IMPLEMENT Complete - Ready for Next Task**

## Active Task
**COMPLETED**: SSE Context Cancellation & Graceful Shutdown Enhancement
- **Primary Issue**: SSE server did not use context to stop when cancelled
- **Secondary Issue**: Application exited with error status during normal shutdown
- **Solution**: 
  1. Implemented context-aware SSE server startup with goroutine and proper cancellation handling
  2. Enhanced main.go to distinguish between context cancellation and actual errors
- **Status**: Fixed, enhanced, tested, and verified
- **Result**: Both SSE and stdio modes now support proper graceful shutdown with clean exit status

## Key Context Items

### Project Identity
- **Name**: go-time-mcp
- **Type**: Go MCP Server Package
- **Primary Function**: Time service provider with timezone and format flexibility

### Technical Stack
- **Language**: Go +1.24
- **Framework**: mcp-go from mark3labs
- **Modes**: SSE server and stdio operation modes

### Current Understanding
- This is a time-focused MCP server project
- Requires dual operation mode support (SSE and stdio)
- Needs timezone-aware time formatting capabilities
- Must provide unix timestamp functionality
- Should follow MCP protocol standards

### VAN Mode Completion Status
1. ✅ Memory Bank structure created
2. ✅ Platform detection completed (Linux)
3. ✅ File verification completed
4. ✅ Complexity determination completed (Level 3)
5. ✅ Mode transition triggered

## Recent Updates
- VAN mode initialization completed successfully
- All checkpoints passed (Memory Bank, Platform, File Verification, Complexity)
- Project determined to be Level 3: Intermediate Feature
- Mode transition to PLAN required for proper planning and design

## Current Status
**Status**: VAN Mode COMPLETE - Level 3 complexity determined
**Next Action**: User must type 'PLAN' to begin planning phase
