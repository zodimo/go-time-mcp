📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Component Architecture
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
   Description: Organize components for handlers and services in a maintainable structure
   Requirements: 
   - Clear separation of concerns between layers
   - Easy to test individual components
   - Support for future feature additions
   - Minimal coupling between components
   Constraints: 
   - Go package structure conventions
   - Must integrate with mcp-go framework
   - Keep complexity appropriate for Level 3 project

2️⃣ OPTIONS
   Option A: Layered Architecture - Traditional layers (handlers → services → data)
   Option B: Modular Architecture - Feature-based modules with internal layering
   Option C: Hexagonal Architecture - Ports and adapters with core business logic

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
   | Criterion | Layered | Modular | Hexagonal |
   |-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | Simplicity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
   | Testability | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Scalability | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Go Conventions | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Learning Curve | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
   
   Key Insights:
   - Layered architecture is simplest and most familiar for Go projects
   - Modular architecture better for feature growth but adds complexity
   - Hexagonal architecture provides best testability but may be overkill for this scope

4️⃣ DECISION
   Selected: Option A: Layered Architecture
   Rationale: Best fit for Level 3 complexity. Simple, follows Go conventions, and provides clear separation without over-engineering. Easy for team members to understand and maintain.
   
5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   - Package structure: internal/handlers/, internal/services/, internal/config/
   - Handlers layer: MCP tool implementations, request/response handling
   - Services layer: Business logic for time operations, validation
   - Config layer: Configuration management and validation
   - Dependencies flow downward: handlers → services → config
   - Use interfaces for service dependencies to enable testing
